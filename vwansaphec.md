# Interconnect SAP HANA Enterprise Cloud environment Running on Azure with Virtual WAN

This article describes the high-level architecture to interconnect a SAP HANA Enterprise Cloud (HEC) environment running on Azure to an Azure virtual WAN. 
The customer systems of an Azure based SAP HEC environments are provisioned in dedicated Azure Virtual Networks (VNets) operated by SAP. Depending on the chosen Service level, usually a single VNet is used for non Disaster Recovery (DR) enabled deployments and two VNets are used for DR enabled deployments where the second VNet is provisioned in the designated DR Region. SAP establishes a global VNet peering between those networks to facilitate replication traffic.

The below diagram depicts a standard Azure based SAP HEC customer environment with DR enabled.

The primary VNet is provisioned within the Azure Region West Europe. Another VNet is provisioned within the North Europe Azure Region. A global VNet peering is established between those two networks in order to allow replication traffic to flow between the two regions. 


Interconnect SAP HEC environment with Azure Virtual WAN 
While it is possible to treat the SAP HEC environment as branches and connect them by setting up Azure VPN Gateways and establish IPSEC Tunnels, the recommended method is to leverage an Azure vWAN VNet connection. An Azure vWAN VNet connection establishes a peering between an VNet and an virtual WAN Hub Network. The virtual WAN HUB Router instances route traffic to and from the connected VNet to all other VNets and branches. There is no requirement to provision Virtual Network Gateways.
An Virtual WAN VNet Connection can be established even if the VNet is not in the same Azure Active Directory (AAD) Tenant hence it can be used to interconnect a SAP HEC environment. 
Fore more information on how to establish a Virtual WAN VNet connection across tenants see  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You cannot connect an Azure Virtual Network to two Azure vWAN Hubs.

Site-2-Site VPN
This option interconnects the SAP environment as branches to Azure virtual WAN. Within the SAP managed Virtual Networks, Azure Virtual Networks Gateway are provisioned and IPSec Tunnels are established between the redundant Azure virtual WAN Gateways provisioned in the Hub and the redundant Azure VPN Gateways in the SAP Virtual Network.

[!NOTE]
Inter-hub with firewall is currently not supported. Traffic between hubs will move directly bypassing the Azure Firewall in each hub.
